# Chockies
Overall, I have thoroughly enjoyed making this website using the structure and features of SpaceY webite.
I initially wanted to make a webapge about a chocolate company but couldn't get high resolution picture images so I had to change the theme. I went for a Studio Ghibli theme.

Lowlights: I mainly struggled with position.
I did some reading on course and CSS and that was helpful. I was able to inser the text in the center of the page to the relative to the section it belongs but also ensuring that the header is fixed. However, hovering one of the box in website forces other secitons to move. This shouldn't happen. I'm working on this.
Margin and padding is also something I need to work on. I couldn't set the header properly as I couldn't manage border/margin/padding.



Highlights: It was really rewarding to see the incremental changes I made on the page: espcially when the result met what I had in mind. I have used things I have learned this week and it makes me want to learn more. The footer of the page is a good example of that. Learning about how to set up a background image with respect to the view height was a cornerstone of this homework. The commits are useful as I could go back and forth during versions and extract things that worked.
